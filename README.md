**Hey there!** 👾 

I'm [**Rayat (Ray)**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayatchowdhury2005), a backend developer based in New York City. 

I build projects that solve my own problems, and often others' too. 

The best ideas often start as the wildest ones. Whether they solve a pressing problem or satisfy pure curiosity, I trust my instincts and build them anyway 🧑‍💻. 

My primary stack is MERN (**MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js**), though I've spent most of my time diving deep into backend development with Express and Node.js.  

I've built several projects I'm proud of, but my favorite is [**Relifio**](https://github.com/TheDonRay/Relifio).
